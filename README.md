# MCP-Modificator
This is a tool that will help modify the [Mod Coder Pack](http://modcoderpack.com) for newer versions of Minecraft. Built for Windows 10.<br>
For Linux or anything else, well, good luck.

# Prerequisites
- Java Runtime Environment 1.8+<br>
- Java Development Kit 8+<br>
- Generally a good knowledge of whatever the hell you're doing.

# How To Use
Run modify_mcp.bat. It should be relatively straightforward.<br>
There may be some little bugs that I may have missed, so if you know how to use this, please help fix them?

# Known Issues
> MCPConfig does not build automatically.
>> This is an issue I personally don't know how to fix. If you know how to point Gradle towards building MCPConfig, please tell me or submit a pull request! That would be greatly appreciated!
